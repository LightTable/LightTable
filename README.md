**Light Table is a next generation code editor that connects you to your creation with instant feedback**. 

**Light Table is very customizable and can display anything a [Chromium browser](http://www.chromium.org/) can.**

### This is a development branch and is not clean like `master` and can have many breakages.

## Downloads

**Prebuilt binaries are available through [lighttable.com](http://lighttable.com). To build and use a developer version of Light Table [see these instructions](doc/developer-install.md).**

For **OSX users**, the install process involves the following steps **until we officially sign our OSX App**:

* In Finder, Ctrl-click on LightTable.app/ and select Open.
* When you see [this prompt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11994/11731454/85181e90-9f69-11e5-9c65-f6aa4228005c.png) about LightTable being unidentified, click Open.
* If Ctrl-click doesn't work for you, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, temporarily change "Allow apps downloaded from:" to Anywhere and double click on LightTable.app.

## Plugins

Light Table has a **powerful plugin system** that allows almost any aspect of the editor to be **extended and customized**. With over [100+ plugins](https://github.com/LightTable/plugin-metadata), the community is able to offer eval support for **new languages, create domain-specific IDEs and much more**. If you're interested in writing your own plugin, see the [Write a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#write-a-plugin) and [Submit a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#submit-a-plugin) docs. For an example ClojureScript plugin, see [LightTable-Declassifier](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable-Declassifier).
