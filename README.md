Light Table is a next generation code editor that connects you to your creation with instant feedback. Light Table is very customizable and can display anything a [Chromium browser](http://www.chromium.org/) can.

## Downloads

Prebuilt binaries are available through [lighttable.com](http://lighttable.com). To build and use a developer version of Light Table [see these instructions](doc/developer-install.md).

For OSX users, the install process involves the following steps until we officially sign our OSX App:

* In Finder, Ctrl-click on LightTable.app/ and select Open.
* When you see [this prompt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11994/11731454/85181e90-9f69-11e5-9c65-f6aa4228005c.png) about LightTable being unidentified, click Open.
* If Ctrl-click doesn't work for you, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, temporarily change "Allow apps downloaded from:" to Anywhere and double click on LightTable.app.

## Documentation

* See [docs.lighttable.com](http://docs.lighttable.com/) for official user documentation and tutorials.
* See the [community wiki](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki) which includes a [User FAQ](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/FAQ) and a [For Users page](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Users) for additional links.
* For a typical Light Table workflow, [read this](doc/workflow.md).
* To understand how Light Table works, read about its [BOT architecture](doc/BOT.md).
* See [Light Table's API docs](http://lighttable.github.io/LightTable/api/index.html) to see what
  plugin authors have access to.
* If you're a user coming from vim or emacs see the [For Vim Users](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Vim-Users) and [For Emacs Users](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Emacs-Users) guides.

## Plugins

Light Table has a powerful plugin system that allows almost any aspect of the editor to be extended and customized. With over [100+ plugins](https://github.com/LightTable/plugin-metadata), the community is able to offer eval support for new languages, create domain-specific IDEs and much more. If you're interested in writing your own plugin, see the [Write a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#write-a-plugin) and [Submit a Plugin](http://docs.lighttable.com/#submit-a-plugin) docs. For an example ClojureScript plugin, see [LightTable-Declassifier](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable-Declassifier).

## Community

Want to ask a question or just say hi? Please do :). Our mailing list is the [Light Table Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/light-table-discussion). We also hang out in `#lighttable` on Freenode IRC.

## For Developers

LightTable is primarily written in [ClojureScript](http://clojure.org/clojurescript). If you aren't familiar with it, check out [David Nolen's tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial).

In order to develop for Light Table, you will need to [install a developer version of Light Table](doc/developer-install.md). For more information, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-contributions) and [For Developers](https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/For-Developers).

## How to report an issue

The following information should be submitted to speed up the issue review process:

### Summary
Fill in a short, one sentence description of the problem. For example, "Saving file in .tiff format causes program to exit."

### Details
This is your long version of the issue. Be as specific as possible. Make sure to give a rational, complete depiction of the problem; saying "The print button is broken" does not describe the problem enough.

### Reproducibility
This is a very important field. Does this happen every time you follow some procedure? Does it only happen on Tuesdays? Was it only once?

### Steps to Reproduce
As discussed earlier, provide the steps you followed to reach the bug. If the problem cannot be reproduced, say so in "Reproducibility" and give the steps to the best of your memory.

### Software Version
Please include the version of the editor you are reporting the bug for.

### Operating System
There are many ways to determine the operating system you are running, but running uname -sr in a terminal is one way to do it.
