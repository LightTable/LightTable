Light Table Playground
======================

Issues and wiki for the Light Table Playground

##Known issues for 0.2.0
* [mac] Doesn't work on 10.6 until I get a machine to compile it on
* [mac] Untaring updates is really slow due to a chromium event loop bug (doesn't impact editing)
* [linux] Frameless windows aren't resizable, so it is framed. Blocked by [chromium bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=156465)
* [win] Child processes bring up a command prompt that steals focus. Will be fixed with next shell release.
* [win] As a result of the above, java connection processes can sometimes live on after the app is closed.
* [all] No context menus - waiting to see what the impact of this is.
