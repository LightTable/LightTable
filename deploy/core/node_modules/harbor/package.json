It will remember\nwhat server is assigned to each port, or which ports are unavailable due to system assignment.\n\n## Installation\n\nHarbor can be installed via [npm](http://npmjs.org).\n\n```sh\nnpm install harbor\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInvoke the `harbor` primary export with a lower and upper bounds of port number to query. Then\nclaim a service name to query for an available port.\n\n```js\nvar harbor = require('harbor')(1227, 1337);\n\nharbor.claim('awesomeness', function (err, port) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(port); // 1227\n});\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Harbor\n\nThe primary export is a factory, but you can also create new Harbors manually.\n\n```js\nvar Harbor = require('harbor')\n  , harbor = new Harbor(1227, 1337);\n```\n\nThe `harbor` constructor object is also an event emitter. \n\n- `claim (name, port)` upon claim of a port\n- `release (name, port)` upon release of a port\n- `full` upon all ports being claimed\n\nShould you run out of ports, you can adjust the `harbor.min` or `harbor.max` to your needs.\n\n#### .claim (name, cb)\n\n- **@param** _{String}_ service name\n- **@param** _{Function}_ callback\n\nFind an available port for a named service. Names must be unique within a given Harbor. If\na claim for a name that already exists, the already assigned port will be returned.\n\nWill emit `claim` event for new, successful claims. Alternatively could emit `full` event in\naddition to returning an error in the callback.\n\n```js\nharbor.claim('awesomeness', function (err, port) {\n  if (err) throw err; // will occur if all available ports are claimed\n  console.log(port); // 1227\n});\n```\n\n#### .release (name)\n\n- **@param** _{String}_ service name\n\nIndicate that the claimed port for `name` is no longer in use and can be returned\nto the pool of available ports. \n\nWill emit `release` event if the port was previously claimed. Releasing a service \nname that does not exist has no impact.\n\n```js\nharbor.release('awesomeness');\n```\n\n#### .claimed\n\n- **@returns** _{Array}_ claimed ports\n\nGet an array of all claimed ports by this harbor interface. Does not include \nports that are in use by system services within the harbor range.\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are written in the BDD styles for the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha) \ntest runner using the `should` assertion interface from [Chai](http://chaijs.com). \nRunning tests is simple:\n\n    make test\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
